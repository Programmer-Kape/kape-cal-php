## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# What's this all about?

A couple of suggestions brought up this project where the KapeVSC community can practice and contribute using their web development skills by developing a simple application.

# This Project

A simple calendar application that allows our discord community members to use it to record meaningful events, notes, and other things that they need to record of data on a particular date and time.

# Requirements

As a user, I want to be able to record my data in a chronological order using calendar grid system so that I could easily recall and share to others what happened on a particular date and time.

## Acceptance Criteria

- users should be able to enter a title and a description box that accepts markdown syntax together with their server discord nickname
- users should be able to filter out only their own calendar entries by remembering their discord nickname when they load the page; this will also display all shared entries by other users
- first time access of the page should prompt the user of their discord server nickname
- user should be able to search their entries by the title and the text from the description box
- user should be able to share their entries to a set of other users based off their discord server nicknames

# The Stack

The project as initialized using [Laravel](https://laravel.com) instructions and published it into the organization's Github repository. This is expected to be developed using Full Stack Laravel project with PHP as the backend and Vanila Javascript/HTML/CSS as the frontend.
